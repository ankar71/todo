## Description

Simple todo app in the style of [todomvc](https://todomvc.com/) implemented using HTMX and the echo framework in golang. It uses bulma for styling.

I created it for the sole puprose of advancing my knowledge in htmx and some golang web framework.

Feel free to explore it or copy it.

## Usage

To run it (assuming you have the go compiler installed), use the command:
`go run .`

Then open your browser on localhost:3000
